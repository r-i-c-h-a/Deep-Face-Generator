# Deep-Face-Generator

Deep learning, has been successfully employed in various fields that require complex problem solving, including big data analytics and computer vision. More recently, deep learning has introduced a set of very interesting algorithms, under the umbrella of Deep-Fake, where these algorithms can generate fake audio, images and videos, that are hard to distinguish from authentic ones. This paper presents experimentation on generation of images with faces, using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs).
